# Semantic-Analysis-Chatbot
# Overview
The Semantic Analysis Chatbot is an interactive web application designed to perform semantic analysis on text inputs. By leveraging cutting-edge NLP models, this app determines the sentiment of a given text, providing insights into whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral, along with a confidence score.

# Features
Semantic Sentiment Analysis: Identifies the sentiment of text input with a confidence percentage.
User-Friendly Interface: An easy-to-use interface built with Gradio.
Real-Time Analysis: Instant results upon entering text.
AI-Powered: Uses state-of-the-art pre-trained models from the Transformers library.
# Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
# Libraries:
Transformers: For NLP model integration.
Gradio: For building the user interface.
Model: BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3, a powerful transformer-based model for semantic understanding.
# How It Works
The user enters text into the input field of the app.
The app processes the input using the pre-trained transformer model to analyze its sentiment.
The output displays the detected sentiment (e.g., Positive, Negative) along with a confidence score.
# Use Cases
Social Media Analysis: Understand the sentiment behind tweets, posts, or comments.
Customer Feedback: Analyze reviews or survey responses for sentiment insights.
Content Moderation: Identify potentially negative or harmful text.
# Installation and Setup
To use the Semantic Analysis Chatbot:

Install the required Python libraries: Transformers and Gradio.
Run the application script locally or deploy it to a server.
Access the app through the provided public or local URL.
# Future Improvements
Support for multiple languages.
Enhanced semantic understanding with custom fine-tuned models.
Sentiment categorization into more nuanced emotions.
Integration with databases for bulk analysis.
